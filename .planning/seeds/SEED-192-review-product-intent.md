# SEED-192: Review product intent as development changes the product

## Why This Matters

For developers reviewing and maintaining product intent, reading test source in
editors and piecing together separate run output should change to a coherent
Intent workspace for Purpose and CI proof. Begin with actual automated
test source and named real projects, within the
[near-future direction](../PRODUCT-BACKLOG.md#near-future-direction) and the
[product intent review memorandum](../../docs/product-intent-review-memorandum.md).
Terry evaluates the first experience. The cost of today's manual workflow has
not been measured; usefulness must be judged against that baseline.

**Decomposition kept 2026-10-31:** Terry requested a visible Development/Intent
frame first, explicit per-project test-folder types, and source browsing.
Terry kept this decomposition and directed the backlog to follow the order
below, with optimization-candidate review after source browsing. Existing story
identities are preserved. The stories remain preparation input; execution
approaches and implementation are not selected by this backlog decision.

## Human-Owned Framing and Constraints

Established by Terry's 2026-10-30 and 2026-10-31 discussions:

- The developer should be able to see and feel the overall frame before the
  Intent reader is built. Development and Intent are the initial perspectives;
  Intent can initially explain that its content is forthcoming. Structure waits.
- Each project explicitly configures its intent locations and what they contain.
  Start with Cucumber source in Doughnut and Pygardon. Automatic detection is
  deferred. Next consider TypeScript, Python, and script tests.
- Purpose initially means actual static test source. File and folder browsing
  needs no runtime reports, generated narrative, or authored intent catalogue.
- Proof comes from CI: Intent's **CI status → Proof** shows the judged run's
  CI proof. CPU and other resources can change run time.
- Preserve the selected project, the shared frame and any story scope across
  Intent's reading modes. Near-future direction belongs in Development.
- The existing optimization-candidate story was requested at priority 2 earlier
  on 2026-10-31. Its links require useful source browsing, not merely an empty
  frame. Terry selected its revised placement after the source-browsing stories,
  at priority 4, when keeping this decomposition on 2026-10-31.
- Story impact, protection, and complexity remain part of the parent direction.
  Source changes and passing runs alone do not establish intent protection.
  Domain models, types, and written specifications remain later extensions.

The first learning question is whether the real frame makes the two perspectives
understandable without disrupting Development. The next is whether explicit
locations make real test source easy to find. The next is whether a story's
intent protection and test complexity can be assessed reliably at justified cost.

## Alternatives and Recommendation

- **Defer:** keeps the existing editor/report workflow, but misses the explicitly
  requested Intent experience. Terry has selected advancement of this direction.
- **Use editors, Review changes, and existing reports:** the strongest smaller
  alternative. It remains the comparison and fallback, and can support early
  protection/complexity reviews. It does not supply the requested integrated
  browsing experience; its quantitative disadvantage is unknown.
- **One source-browser story for every language:** possible as delivery
  checkpoints, but plain text, folders, and explicit file selection are the same
  observable behavior. A Python-only reader adds no demonstrated independent
  outcome after a configurable text reader exists. Recommend a Cucumber pilot,
  then one general source-browsing increment evaluated with TypeScript, Python,
  Node, and shell examples. Split only if refinement reveals distinct behavior.
- **Recommended:** deliver the visible frame and source access, then test the
  protection and complexity reviews on a real story.

## Research Basis and Architectural Considerations

### Observed project inventory

Read-only inspection on 2026-10-31; these are checkout observations, not new test
runs or measurements. Open Dough was inspected at `7e198a7c3374`; Doughnut at
`1233bbd6db20`; Pygardon at `5df070ed54fc`. No client-project files were changed.

| Project | Initial source locations | Actual runners and relevant distinctions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open Dough | `dashboard/tests/`; shell checks under `tests/`; Node tests under `tests/`, `scripts/`, and skill-script locations selected by the existing test command | Dashboard TypeScript tests use Playwright Test, not Vitest. `scripts/test.sh` schedules shell checks and `node --test` files. |
| Doughnut | `e2e_test/features/`; frontend test locations under `frontend/`; Node script tests under `scripts/` and `infra/` | Cucumber features run through Cypress and `@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor`. Frontend Vitest uses real-browser projects, including touch, with different CI retry/parallel settings. |
| Pygardon | `e2e_test/features/`; separately `e2e_test/packaged/features/`; colocated tests under `frontend/src/`; `tests/` for pytest | Cucumber.js uses Playwright as browser automation. Its CI profile and tags differ from local defaults. Frontend uses Vitest with happy-dom. pytest defaults and CI exclude different slow/host-only selections. |

Doughnut also has CLI Vitest, CLI Python unittest, and Java/JUnit backend tests.
The requested Pygardon Python increment means pytest, not all Python tests in
all projects. Java/JUnit and additional CLI/packaged profiles are scope choices
for later selection; a generic source reader need not prohibit them. Source
browsing does not imply their execution evidence is already supported.

### Constraints from current Accepted ADRs

- [ADR 0001 — Ubiquitous language](../../docs/adrs/0001-ubiquitous-language-accepted.md):
  keep Development, Product intent, Purpose, and Proof distinct. An initial
  scope limit does not justify a product gate against another readable format.
- [ADR 0002 — Software development lifecycle principles](../../docs/adrs/0002-software-development-lifecycle-principles-accepted.md):
  retain useful stopping points, reuse suitable existing solutions, and build
  supporting machinery when the selected outcome needs it. Delivery order alone
  does not justify blocking story dependencies.
- [ADR 0008 — Project dashboard domain and architecture](../../docs/adrs/0008-project-dashboard-domain-and-architecture-accepted.md):
  repository records own durable project facts; published facts, local
  observations, and disposable UI state stay distinguishable. Project registration
  and machine paths remain host settings. No application/server database is selected.
- [ADR 0010 — Definition of improvement](../../docs/adrs/0010-definition-of-improvement-accepted.md):
  compare the useful review with the existing manual workflow, including human
  effort, collection overhead, retained data, and future maintenance cost.
- [ADR 0000 — Use ADRs](../../docs/adrs/0000-use-adrs-accepted.md):
  this Intent-specific direction belongs with product intent and planning.
  No new ADR acceptance, supersession, or exception is proposed. Relevant index
  and record statuses agree; no conflict was found in this recommendation.

### Recommended boundaries for refinement

These are proposed responsibilities and evidence semantics, not a technical
schema, executable design, or a newly accepted architecture decision.

1. **Project-owned configuration:** record intent roots, explicit source kind,
   and file selection in each repository's `.planning/open-dough.json`, extending
   its existing project settings. File selection matters for colocated tests and mixed helper folders.
   Read config and source at the same named published revision. Missing config,
   an empty configured location, and a failed read have different meanings.
   Dashboard project registration remains machine-local. A settings editor is
   not needed for the first browsing story; repository configuration suffices.
2. **Reuse the existing frame and source concepts:** the current React dashboard
   already has project selection, session preservation, settings navigation,
   review file trees, exact source text, and authenticated pinned Git reads.
   These inform reuse; they are not a ready-made Intent tree. The current
   published-directory helper lists files only, while story-review text is
   admitted within a particular comparison. Intent needs its own project/root
   reading scope without depending on a live session or story workspace.

## Shared Evidence and Sizing Boundaries

Follow the [initial Intent UX/UI direction](../../docs/dashboard-ux-ui-north-star.md#initial-intent-workspace).
Every candidate is evaluated by Terry or a developer reviewing the named project.
Every stopping point preserves useful behavior without later stories. Source
reads name their revision; Proof names its actual run and supported scope.
Missing observations remain unknown. No synthetic sample establishes a real pass.

Open Dough has no established S/M/L calibration, as already recorded here and in
[SEED-052](SEED-052-start-agent-work-from-dashboard.md#open-decisions-before-refinement-or-planning).
No bands or time commitments are invented. Comparative hypotheses below are
unbanded; confidence includes integration, verification, and cleanup.

## Ordering, Existing Stories, and Scope Reduction

Terry selected the backlog order on 2026-10-31. That order did not establish
a mandatory dependency chain. The Cucumber source pilot closed as
SEED-192#browse-test-purpose and is not duplicated under a new identity. Other
existing review candidates retain their outcomes.

The selected order starts with the frame (1), then the Cucumber pilot (2), then
other configured source (3). The strongest rejected smaller option for the
frame is a disposable mockup: Terry explicitly wants to experience the real
interface and return to working Development. This story is justified by that
learning, not merely as infrastructure for later readers.

The earlier optimization-candidate priority becomes selected position 4, after
its source-navigation prerequisites. Story impact (5) keeps the review centered
on a story.

The kept decomposition differs from Terry's rough sequence deliberately: it
combines language-only source extensions when they share the same reading
outcome, retaining TypeScript, Python, Node, and shell as real evaluation
examples.

No formal blocking dependency has been recorded: common code and delivery order
alone do not establish that another story cannot start. Each consumer owns its
integration. Establish a blocking agreement later only if refinement demonstrates
an actual supplier outcome required before work can start.

If investment must shrink, retain the source-only product after 3 and keep an
early protection review to test the parent direction's hardest assumption.

## Open Decisions Before Refinement or Planning

- Establish Open Dough S/M/L calibration before assigning bands. Comparative
  uncertainty is recorded; no borrowed client-project timing policy applies.

## When to Surface

Terry kept this revised decomposition and its backlog order on 2026-10-31.
Refine one selected story before
execution planning.

## Breadcrumbs

- Terry's 2026-10-30 direction: initial source browser, story scope, and
  longer-term forms of intent expression.
- Terry's earlier 2026-10-31 request: optimization candidates and accepted slow
  tests at priority 2, with links into the test-source browser.
- Terry's current 2026-10-31 request: decompose the broad first story, lead with
  the real frame, use explicit folder types across Open Dough/Doughnut/Pygardon.
- Terry's 2026-10-31 keep and landing instruction: retain this decomposition,
  queue its stories in the proposed order, and place optimization-candidate
  review after source browsing.
