# SEED-008: Execute stories with continuous trunk integration

## Why This Matters

Developers want agents to work in separate worktrees while sharing small,
verified changes through the team's trunk throughout a story. Workspace
isolation must not postpone integration until the story is complete.

## Stories

<a id="same-machine-merge-queue"></a>

### 2. Queue trunk integration for agents on the same machine

**Status:** Captured; second backlog priority. Not refined or planned.

**Goal:** A developer running multiple agents in separate worktrees on the same
machine gets orderly integration into their shared trunk without manually
arbitrating each agent's turn or letting agents mutate the integration checkout
at the same time.

**Scope candidate:** Introduce a same-machine merge queue for Trunk Mode.
Agents submit ready increments; one integration runs at a time, reconciles with
current trunk, and reports its result to the submitting agent. Preserve the
local execution branches, trunk publication, and CI ownership established by
Trunk Mode. Failed or interrupted integration must preserve the submitted work
and leave a visible state that can be recovered without duplicate publication.

**Key example / evaluation:** Two agents submit increments from different
worktrees while sharing one integration target. Both increments eventually
reach trunk, each is reconciled against preceding integrated work, and neither
agent concurrently modifies the integration checkout. An integration that
cannot proceed reports its blocked state without losing either submission.

**Depends on:** completed Introduce Trunk Mode for plan execution, recoverable
from `ef6a59c:.planning/seeds/SEED-008-worktree-branch-trunk-sync.md#introduce-trunk-mode`.
Trunk Mode remains usable through explicit coordination without this queue.

**Deferred decisions:** Queue ordering/fairness, whether a blocked submission
allows later independent work through, admission and cancellation interfaces,
crash recovery, and how an agent knows who owns an integration. Resolve these
when refining this story; no daemon, storage format, or locking design is chosen.

**Boundaries:** One machine and one repository's shared integration target per
queue. Distributed queues, hosted cloud-agent integration, a parallel-agent
launcher, and global CI repair scheduling are not promised. Reuse an existing
solution if suitable; this capture authorizes no queue implementation.

### 4. Update the product backlog without hand-editing the shared list

**Status:** Captured; middle backlog priority. Not refined or planned.

**For / why:** An Open Dough maintainer coordinating parallel agents can add,
take, reorder, or complete work in the plain-text product backlog through a
stable operation, so concurrent queue changes do not repeatedly require manual
reconstruction of overlapping Markdown-list edits.

**Scope candidate:** Keep the Markdown backlog as the canonical, human-readable
view while introducing script-backed operations over stable work identities and
relative priority. Preserve exact story titles, canonical links, **Taken** and
**Backlog list** semantics, existing unrelated order, and the near-future
direction. Reject stale anchors, ambiguous identities, duplicates, and malformed
sections without partially writing the file. Do not introduce a service,
database, second backlog representation, or automated priority policy.

**Evaluation:** Starting from the same backlog revision, two worktrees add
different middle-priority stories. Integrating their script-expressed changes
retains both entries in the intended relative order without a maintainer
hand-editing `PRODUCT-BACKLOG.md`. A stale or ambiguous operation stops with a
specific diagnostic, and every successful result remains ordinary readable
Markdown.

**Value / learning:** The first useful increment tests whether stable,
script-backed queue operations remove the recurring list-edit hotspot while
retaining the product backlog's low-complexity plain-text form. Direct editing
plus later conflict reconstruction remains available, but it repeats the
coordination cost this story is intended to reduce.

**Effort hypothesis:** S–M, low confidence; local queue operations are small,
but proving compatible concurrent additions and lifecycle transitions may
expose a need for a durable operation representation.

**Depends on:** The existing canonical backlog identity and lifecycle
conventions. No new product prerequisite.

**Architecture and boundaries:** This advances decentralized coordination and
continuous integration under
[ADR 0002 — Software development lifecycle principles](../../docs/adrs/0002-software-development-lifecycle-principles-accepted.md)
while keeping one canonical representation. ADR 0007 remains Proposed and is
not adopted by this capture.

**Safe stopping point:** Maintainers can apply one validated queue change
without hand-editing the list; later automation can be cancelled without
changing the readable Markdown backlog or its established semantics.

### 5. Publish Trunk Mode from local main

**Status:** Captured; before same-machine queue integration. Not refined or
planned.

**For / why:** A developer using Trunk Mode can treat local `main` as the
integration point and the sole source of publication to `origin/main`, so the
local repository reflects each integrated increment before that increment is
shared remotely.

**Scope candidate:** Change Trunk Mode publication so a verified increment is
first merged into local `main`, the retained execution branch is then rebased
onto that updated local `main`, and local `main` is reconciled by rebasing onto
the latest `origin/main` before local `main` is pushed to `origin/main`. Preserve
exclusive integration ownership, recoverable conflict stops, proof revalidation,
ordinary non-force pushes, exact published-SHA tracking, and CI registration.
Do not publish the execution branch.

**Evaluation:** Given a verified execution increment and an unchanged remote,
local `main` contains the merged increment and the execution branch is based on
that local result before `origin/main` advances from local `main`. When
`origin/main` advances concurrently, only this execution's unpublished local
work is reconciled onto the fetched remote state; successful revalidation is
followed by a push from local `main`, while a conflict or ambiguous ownership
preserves all local branches and reports the exact blocked state.

**Value / learning:** This establishes whether local-first integration gives
developers a clearer recoverable trunk and a better base for continued work
without weakening frequent remote publication or overwriting another writer's
changes.

**Depends on:** The existing Trunk Mode execution identity, proof, publication,
and observer contracts. Complete this before the same-machine merge queue so
the queue automates the selected local-to-remote integration path rather than
the current publication sequence.

**Deferred decisions:** Refine the exact merge strategy, how to avoid replaying
an increment when the execution branch is rebased after its merge, which proofs
the local and remote rebases invalidate, and recovery after interruption at
each boundary. This capture selects the requested ordering but does not choose
unsafe Git commands or authorize implementation.

**Architecture and boundaries:** This advances continuous integration under
[ADR 0002 — Software development lifecycle principles](../../docs/adrs/0002-software-development-lifecycle-principles-accepted.md).
ADR 0007 remains Proposed and is not adopted or changed by this capture.

## Research and Architectural Context

Research on 2026-09-16 established precedent for frequent mainline integration
from local branches, including after each healthy commit. It did not establish
that this exact worktree lifecycle is a mainstream built-in mode, or measure its
agent overhead. [Fowler's branching patterns](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html)
and [Git rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) inform the selected approach.
This resolves the original feasibility concern sufficiently for refinement;
host-specific behavior still needs evidence when implemented.

[ADR 0002 — Software development lifecycle principles](../../docs/adrs/0002-software-development-lifecycle-principles-accepted.md),
principle 2, supports continuous integration and resolving conflicts through
shared intent. [ADR 0005 — Cross-tool validation](../../docs/adrs/0005-cross-tool-validation-accepted.md)
governs proof and native acceptance. [ADR 0006 — Write skills for executing agents](../../docs/adrs/0006-write-skills-for-executing-agents-accepted.md)
requires one shared behavior with only necessary host adaptation, written for
the executing project. Follow [maintainer guidance](../../AGENTS.md) when authoring.

[ADR 0007 — Software development lifecycles](../../docs/adrs/0007-software-development-lifecycles.md)
remains Proposed. Its Story Branch Mode waits until closure to integrate;
Trunk Mode introduces another mode without accepting or superseding that draft.
The existing source guidance assumes execution-branch publication and end-only
integration; changing those assumptions for Trunk Mode is within this story,
not grounds for silently changing the behavior of the other modes.
