# SEED-285 — Understand timing changes in landed CI

## Why This Matters

For a developer reviewing a project or a Done story, today's CI status and
story comparison show individual builds. To see whether timings are drifting,
the developer must piece together previous runs and check their proof. Intent
should show how landed CI time has changed, let the developer trace that change
to a test entry, folder, or file, and surface a possible slowdown that persists
after one repeat measurement.

The history covers landed executions whose Done messages the dashboard received
and whose landing it recorded. Background collection starts from Done and uses
the recorded trunk revision. The history and moving average read only collected
evidence. CI remains the source of observed run outcomes. A retry is a
measurement on the landed revision and the story remains Done during it.

## Alternatives and Decision

Keep today's comparison and manually review or rerun individual CI runs. This
can resolve a particular concern, but requires the developer to assemble the
history each time. The strongest smaller option is the project chart alone.
It shows drift and tests whether the dashboard collects enough comparable
landings, but leaves the developer to locate the change in test proof and
decide whether it survives a repeat. Start with the chart as the first useful
increment. Add automation after the historical reference can be reviewed.

## Story Decomposition

<a id="retry-a-slow-landed-ci-build"></a>

### Repeat a slow landed CI build once and flag a persistent slowdown

**Identity:** SEED-285#retry-a-slow-landed-ci-build
```json dough-story-state
{"schemaVersion":1,"refinement":"not-refined","approach":"unselected"}
```

- **For / why.** A developer reviewing Recently done can see whether an unusually slow build recovered on a repeat or still needs attention.
- **Evaluation.** In a project that enables the behavior, a Done execution has a complete landed CI measurement at least a proposed 5% slower than its displayed moving average. The dashboard requests one full rerun of the same landed workflow run. The Done story card shows **CI rerun in progress** while it runs. If the completed rerun is still at or above the threshold against the same baseline, the card shows a red **Possible CI slowdown** indicator with both timings and the comparison. A rerun below the threshold shows that timing returned to range.
- **Boundary.** The timing rule is deterministic. Use comparable timing on both attempts and the same baseline for the decision and display. The dashboard requests at most one rerun per landing, even if Done is delivered twice or the dashboard restarts. Only a successful, complete measurement of the exact landing with sufficient comparable history can trigger the rerun. A refused, failed, or incomplete rerun is an unverified timing outcome and has its own explanation on the card.
- **Value / learning.** One repeat distinguishes an isolated slow measurement from a possible persistent slowdown at a known landed revision.
- **Effort driver.** The highest operational uncertainty is authorizing the repeat and keeping its in-progress and final states trustworthy across retries and restarts.
- **Depends on.** A usable project-level moving average and a CI provider that can rerun the landed workflow with the project's authorization. GitHub Actions supports a repeat at the original revision. [GitHub Actions reruns](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/re-run-workflows-and-jobs)
- **Safe stopping point.** Every automatic attempt has a visible outcome or an explanation, with a firm one-rerun cap and the story still Done.

## Ordering and Scope Reduction

Trace real historical proof before relying on scoped comparisons. The moving average is useful on its own and gives
developers a chance to judge its exclusions before enabling reruns. Defer the
automatic rerun first if scope shrinks. The two histories remain useful if the
moving-average rule also needs more observation. Open Dough has no calibrated
S/M/L bands, so these candidates carry effort drivers and leave bands open.

## Open Decisions

- The [delivered comparison](../../docs/dashboard-development-intent-ci-reference.md) defines its initial window, minimum, completeness and exclusion rules. Review their usefulness before enabling automatic reruns; the later story's proposed 5% rerun trigger remains a separate hypothesis.
- Choose a consistent wall-time basis across first attempts and reruns, and which eligible attempt represents a landing in later averages. Keep both observed attempts available for review.
- Confirm which projects should enable automatic reruns after developers have reviewed the baseline against real landing history.
