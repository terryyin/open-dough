# DearDough Process Findings

## DD-001 — Mixed execution changes obscure commit provenance

The execution's product changes were committed together with a much larger,
separately described cleanup, so the commit does not identify the Taken-work
outcome as one of its responsibilities.

### Occurrences

- Execution: `SEED-004#show-stories-as-taken-during-execution @ 519bb4a`
  - Tool: Codex
  - Model: GPT-5
  - Evidence: `519bb4a` changes 147 files; the Taken outcome occupies eight
    files, while the commit subject describes only removal of Quick 040 and
    DearDough material.
  - Observed effect: The retrospective had to isolate the eight relevant
    patches instead of reviewing the commit as one uncontaminated execution.
  - Inference: Separate commits for independently completed work would make
    review scope, attribution, and recovery clearer.

## DD-002 — Planless Taken work lacks closure evidence

This story was intentionally implemented without a slice plan, but the current
wrap-up workflow requires a plan identity, completed slice state, and a
plan-recorded retrospective completion marker.

### Occurrences

- Execution: `SEED-004#show-stories-as-taken-during-execution @ 519bb4a`
  - Tool: Codex
  - Model: GPT-5
  - Evidence: The story records direct planless implementation and remains under
    **Taken**; `dough-story-wrap-up` requires the selected work's executable
    plan and retrospective-completion evidence.
  - Observed effect: The execution can be reviewed from the story, conversation,
    and commit, but it cannot satisfy the existing wrap-up closure contract.
  - Inference: Planless execution needs either an explicit one-off closure
    decision or a deliberately designed closure record; retroactively inventing
    a plan would misrepresent the execution.

Resolution: On 2026-09-10, the human authorized a one-off closure for this
execution and retained the existing plan-required wrap-up contract unchanged.

## DD-003 — File-type assumptions skipped affected maintained proof

Slice implementation and refactor handoffs treated runtime Markdown changes as
having no applicable maintained tests, even though one changed phrase was an
explicit contract in the focused CI runtime suite.

### Occurrences

- Execution: `SEED-004#execute-in-worktree-and-merge-at-wrap-up @ 8a1be3c`
  - Tool: Codex
  - Model: GPT-5
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.8
  - Evidence: Slice 2 changed the observer identity phrase in
    `ci-monitor.md`; runs `34550693158` and `34551244098` failed
    `ci-supported-host-contract.test.mjs`; repair `2272133` restored the stable
    phrase and all later branch runs passed.
  - Observed effect: Slice 4 paused, its work was stashed and restored, and a
    repair commit was required before execution could continue.
  - Inference: Selecting focused proof from file type instead of tracing the
    changed contract to maintained tests caused avoidable CI repair churn.

## DD-004 — Exact CI repair recovery preserved in-progress slice work

The asynchronous repair protocol isolated a real failure without losing or
mixing the active slice, then resumed the same implementation from its precise
handoff.

### Occurrences

- Execution: `SEED-004#execute-in-worktree-and-merge-at-wrap-up @ 8a1be3c`
  - Tool: Codex
  - Model: GPT-5
  - Open Dough release: 0.3.8
  - Evidence: Run `34550693158` triggered a safe Slice 4 pause; stash
    `38c6397e97c663307d721496998200c3da10768c` preserved its two paths while
    `2272133` repaired CI, after which the exact stash was applied and dropped.
  - Observed effect: Slice 4 resumed with its completed fixture proof and
    partial guidance intact; the older unrelated stash remained untouched.
  - Inference: Explicit writer quiescence, exact stash identity, and focused
    repair delivery formed a useful recovery boundary for worktree execution.
