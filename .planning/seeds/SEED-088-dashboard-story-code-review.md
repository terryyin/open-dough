# SEED-088: Dashboard story code review

## Why This Matters

A developer reviewing a story needs to see its combined result across the
worktree. One dashboard review UI makes the complete change understandable
without piecing together individual commits or session outputs.

## Story

<a id="review-uncommitted-changes"></a>

### Review only a story's uncommitted changes

**Identity:** SEED-088#review-uncommitted-changes
```json dough-story-state
{"schemaVersion":1,"refinement":"not-refined","approach":"unselected"}
```

**Goal:** A developer on the machine where a Trunk Mode story's agent works
can review only the changes still uncommitted in its work tree (staged,
unstaged and untracked), so they can check work in progress before it is
committed. In Story Branch Mode, the full review also offers a check to
include or leave out the work tree's uncommitted changes.

**Scope:** Builds on the
[story review](../../dashboard/AGENT-LAUNCH-REVIEW.md), whose snapshot
already combines commits with uncommitted files. Story Branch Mode's
uncommitted-only view is the Uncommitted changes item of
[Commits comparison](../../dashboard/STORY-REVIEW-COMMITS.md) (Terry, 2026-10-08), so this
story keeps the Trunk Mode view and the check. To be refined: which work tree
a Trunk Mode story names, how its uncommitted-only view is chosen, and the
check's default.

### Review only a Trunk Mode story's own changes

**Identity:** SEED-088#review-trunk-mode-story-changes
```json dough-story-state
{"schemaVersion":1,"refinement":"not-refined","approach":"unselected"}
```

**Goal:** A developer reviewing a story executed in Trunk Mode, whose commits
are continuously merged or rebased onto `origin` trunk, can review only the
changes that story's agent made, even when its commits are interwoven with
other people's commits on trunk.

**Scope:** Builds on the
[story review](../../dashboard/AGENT-LAUNCH-REVIEW.md); the merge-base
baseline shows nothing once the story's commits are on trunk. To be refined:
how the story's commits are recognized on trunk, whether only its changes can
be highlighted when other commits touch the same files, and how this combines
with reviewing only what changed since the last review. Today
since-the-review treats everything between the marked baseline and the
current one as trunk's, so story work that reaches trunk after the mark is
left out and an otherwise empty review says nothing changed beyond what trunk
now holds; recognizing the story's own commits there would let it list them.

## Breadcrumbs

- [Product backlog](../PRODUCT-BACKLOG.md).
- Terry's 2026-10-03 request: capture this story at the top of the backlog;
  consolidate all worktree changes into one dashboard code review with a
  toggleable changed-file browser and a code diff view.
- 2026-10-03 refinement: Terry asked for the narrowest scope that delivers the
  review. The model is GitHub's pull request changed files view and
  IntelliJ's combined review of several commits. Terry chose the unlanded-vs-trunk
  baseline, a snapshot with Refresh, and the latest launch's worktree.
- [Dough Land](../../src/skills/dough-land/SKILL.md) computes a landing baseline
  from the accepted SHA, the starting revision, or the merge-base. The review
  uses only the merge-base, because trunk merges into a published story branch
  would make a starting-revision baseline show trunk changes as story changes.
- `dashboard/server/defaultCheckoutChanges.ts` already reads the default
  checkout's changed paths with `git status`.
- Terry's 2026-10-05 request: queue reviewing a story's uncommitted
  changes (with a Story Branch Mode check to include them) at priority three,
  and reviewing only a Trunk Mode story's own changes at priority four.
- 2026-10-05 refinement of since-the-last-review: Terry chose an explicit Mark
  reviewed, opening on since-the-review with a switch to all changes, and
  listing a file that trunk and the story both changed with a flag. Leaving
  trunk's changes out borrows finance's constant-currency comparison: restate
  the earlier figure at today's rate, then compare. Here the marked snapshot
  is restated on today's baseline and compared with the current snapshot.
  Observed on Git 2.50.1: `git merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base=<marked
  baseline> <marked tree> <current baseline>` gives that restated tree, exits
  1 and names the files it could not merge, and a ref can hold a bare tree
  through `git gc --prune=now`. Unlike a currency rate, a restatement can
  conflict, which is why an overlapping file is flagged instead of separated.
