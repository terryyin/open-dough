# SEED-021: Understand published project progress through a story dashboard

## Why This Matters

For Terry and developers using Open Dough, reconstructing project progress by
reading backlog, seed, plan, and branch files should become a coherent visual
view of published work, using only Git origin and without a local coordination
service or database.

Terry is a visual thinker and expects the story perspective to make continuous
trunk integration easier to understand. Today, separate story branches and
manual avoidance of dependent parallel work provide some of that clarity.
Single-agent Trunk Mode experiments are the immediate opportunity to test
whether a dashboard helps before adding same-machine concurrency.
The intended experience is an animated, zoomable stage with connected work
stages, rather than just a list. Apply it just in time: the first increment
needs a readable connected overview, not every interaction in that ambition.

The [story dashboard](../../dashboard/README.md) now delivers the published-work
overview, selection among Open Dough, Doughnut, and Pygardon, and preparation
and readiness inspection. The remaining stories extend slice-plan navigation,
ownership, and branch visibility. This seed is planning input, not an executable
plan. UX/UI guidance
and tech-stack selection are separate design tasks; their output informs refinement without becoming extra technical
preparation stories.

## Alternatives and Recommendation

- **Defer:** Continue reading Git and Markdown manually. This costs no dashboard
  work but delays testing Terry's explicit visual-understanding hypothesis.
- **Smaller change:** Improve backlog formatting and source links. Useful for
  readers, but still requires assembling a story's context from several files.
- **Existing/manual workflow:** Use the remote repository's file and branch
  browser. This is the strongest simpler alternative and remains the evidence
  reference. It exposes the records but does not provide the requested coherent
  visual account of backlog membership and story progress.
- **Recommended:** Build one read-only story dashboard from actual published
  records. Deliver a useful overview first, then add deeper progress and remote
  story-branch visibility only while their value is supported by use.

The user has selected the visual-dashboard direction and remote-first boundary.
The comparison above and the story cuts below are recommendations for review,
not evidence that a dashboard has already proved more useful than repository
browsing. The delivered overview lets that assumption be tested in use.

## Boundaries Shared by the Stories

- Follow the Git branching and integration direction in
  [ADR 0009](../../docs/adrs/0009-git-branching-and-integration.md), which remains
  Proposed. Remote trunk supplies shared backlog context; a recorded remote
  story branch supplies Story Branch Mode progress. Publication evidence is the
  accepted revision in remote history. Default-checkout freshness and ownership
  are separate machine-local facts, relevant to the later operational view.

- Start with one client project hardcoded in the Open Dough dashboard project.
  Terry selected Open Dough's public GitHub origin, integration branch `main`,
  and local dashboard launch on 2026-09-19. No sign-in, hosted deployment,
  project-registration service, or general project picker in the delivered overview.
  The dashboard now also observes Doughnut and Pygardon as human-selected
  projects, whose metadata may remain hardcoded; this does not introduce a
  portfolio dashboard.
- The dashboard reads published origin state. Its required evidence is available
  from the remote repository across both independent clones and same-machine
  worktrees. Agent profiles published beside the backlog are the
  workflow-produced assignment records; the dashboard observes their published
  contents.
- No application/server database or separate persistent project-state authority.
  Disposable browser storage for preferences or cache is allowed, not required.
- Use strong typing across the implementation and validate externally read
  state. The stack task selects concrete tools; Playwright is a candidate, not
  a prerequisite chosen by this seed.
- Preserve story identity, queue order, and distinctions between missing,
  conflicting, and positively recorded information. Taken does not mean live.
- The delivered overview observes existing records. Story 2 owns readiness
  recording through display; Taken cards already read slice progress where it
  is published, including an execution branch. Story 5 owns the producer-to-display journey
  for execution completion
  and product learnings. Unavailable
  metadata remains explicit. Local checkout activity belongs to the later
  operational view.
- Feature and structural perspectives, recent-completion history views,
  automatic takeover, and local operational visualization remain outside this
  set. No percentage estimates of whole-story completion; a count of recorded
  slice statuses is recorded fact, not such an estimate.

## Story Decomposition

<a id="see-finished-execution"></a>

### 5. See when an execution has finished and what it learned before wrap-up

**Identity:** SEED-021#see-finished-execution
```json dough-story-state
{"schemaVersion":1,"refinement":"not-refined","approach":"unselected"}
```

**Status:** Decomposed 2026-09-24; not refined or planned.

**For / why:** Terry can see in the dashboard that a Taken story's execution
and retrospective have finished and it is waiting for wrap-up, and can read
its product learnings there, instead of finding them only in an execution's
chat.

**Outcome:** When the execution retrospective finishes, it commits and
publishes what it wrote (a correction plan or process findings) to the
execution's publication destination, and records in the story's plan that
execution is complete, along with the retrospective's product learnings. The
dashboard shows the completed state and those learnings. Wrap-up digests the
learnings and deletes the plan as it does today.

**Evaluation:** After a retrospective finishes on a Story Branch Mode story,
the dashboard shows the story as execution complete with its product
learnings, from the published branch, before wrap-up runs.

**Value / learning:** Makes "done but not wrapped up" visible and keeps
product learnings from being lost in a conversation.

**Depends on:** The delivered Taken progress source (see the dashboard
README).

**Open questions for refinement:** The retrospective currently must not
commit or push and leaves its records to wrap-up; this reverses that
ownership. Settle the destination for each mode, what marks completion when
the retrospective is skipped, how the plan records completion and learnings
(its header `Status:` is not maintained today), and CI observation of that
push. The change spans installed guidance in Codex, Cursor, and Claude Code
as well as the dashboard.

**Effort hypothesis:** Unestimated.

## Ordering and Scope Reduction

The delivered overview supplies a usable dashboard for testing the central value
hypothesis in use, now proven useful across Doughnut and Pygardon as well as
Open Dough. Published agent profiles now make responsibility and execution
context explicit, and Taken cards follow it into published work that has not
reached trunk.
Story 5 follows directly, making finished executions and their product
learnings visible before wrap-up. This moves an important excluded outcome ahead of branch inspection without
enlarging the delivered overview.

For a smaller finish line, drop story 5.
The delivered overview is the smallest selected finish line for a usable
overview beyond Open Dough. Neither the feature/structure perspectives nor
recently completed history are added merely to complete a catalog of potential
views.

Refinement and readiness facts stay with the workflow that records them and the
dashboard that reads them. A separate state framework is not independently
valuable. Recent-completion history remains an unselected hypothesis for the
same reason.

Execution-delivery simplification and the remaining remote
dashboard outcomes precede preparation/closure migration and same-machine
coordination. This preserves the remote-first direction without
making dashboard value wait for every publication caller to migrate. The product
backlog owns the actual order; this seed supplies non-executable story scope.

## Open Decisions

- The delivered overview's project and launch are settled: public Open Dough on GitHub,
  `main`, launched locally. Other providers and private access remain outside
  the selected first outcome.
- Define effort bands if S/M/L estimates are wanted. The remaining stories stay
  unestimated rather than importing another project's sizing policy.

## When to Surface

While Terry trials Trunk Mode and the common publication contract, use each
delivered view to reconsider the next visibility outcome.

## Breadcrumbs

- [Project visibility requirements](../../docs/project-visibility-requirements.md)
  retain the detailed product direction and deferred local behavior.
- [ADR 0008](../../docs/adrs/0008-project-dashboard-domain-and-architecture.md)
  is Proposed; this seed follows its discussed intention without accepting it.
- [ADR 0001](../../docs/adrs/0001-ubiquitous-language-accepted.md) supplies story
  and slice language; [ADR 0002](../../docs/adrs/0002-software-development-lifecycle-principles-accepted.md)
  supports small valuable increments and learning before further machinery.
- The [UX/UI North Star](../../docs/dashboard-ux-ui-north-star.md) supplies
  revisable design guidance. Deliver only the breadth selected by each story;
  its broader discovery ideas are not implicit expansion of this seed.
  The [strongly typed stack recommendation](../../docs/dashboard-tech-stack.md)
  informs implementation choices; its broader test examples and discovery
  possibilities do not expand the selected story's outcome.
- [Default-checkout coordination](SEED-008-worktree-branch-trunk-sync.md#same-machine-merge-queue)
  owns direct edits, refresh access, and local recovery. Agent profiles are
  recorded through owned workflow workspaces and remote publication; the
  dashboard reads the resulting evidence.
