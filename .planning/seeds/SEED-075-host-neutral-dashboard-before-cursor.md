# SEED-075: Make shared dashboard code host-neutral before Cursor

## Why This Matters

Claude Code and Codex already sit behind one `LaunchHost` boundary in
`dashboard/server/launchHosts.ts`, and shared code never imports another host's
private helpers. Shared server and browser code still decides by host name,
though, and its fallbacks answer for any host it does not name. Adding Cursor on
top of that would mean editing shared ternaries, inheriting Claude's or Codex's
wording and alert rules. The review of the
delivered integrations (2026-10-01, at `1cdd476c`) ranked these four changes
ahead of Cursor; Terry selected them and their order. Each keeps an operation a
host lacks unavailable rather than supplied by another host
([ADR 0005](../../docs/adrs/0005-cross-tool-validation-accepted.md)).

### Startup recovery advice comes from the host description

**Identity:** SEED-075#startup-advice-from-host-description

- **Goal:** A developer recovering an interrupted or uncertain session start
  reads advice in that session's host's own terms, so a new host such as Cursor
  gets correct startup status and recovery wording without shared code naming
  hosts.
- **Scope:** The startup status and Startup recovery wording added by
  SEED-072 (`dashboard/src/StartupStatus.tsx`, which replaces a literal
  “Claude Code” with the host's name, and `NativeCheck` in
  `dashboard/src/StartupRecovery.tsx`, which branches on `host === "claude"`)
  read host-specific advice from the host description
  (`dashboard/src/hostDescription.ts`, e.g. beside `uncertaintyHint`). Preserve
  today's Claude Code and Codex wording and the recovery controls offered.
- **Key examples:**
  1. A Codex start needs reconciliation → Startup recovery shows its native
     check → the advice is Codex's, taken from Codex's host description.
  2. A host whose description supplies no native-check advice → its start
     needs reconciliation → no other host's advice is shown.
  3. A Codex execution is starting → the card's startup status names Codex
     without shared code rewriting a Claude Code sentence.
- **Related:** SEED-075#host-neutral-session-meaning forbids replacing a literal
  “Claude Code” in shared presentation; its plan predates these startup files,
  so coordinate with that Taken execution. The plan for
  SEED-072#durable-startup-reconciliation also rewords recovery answers.
- **Capture:** Terry asked for this story on 2026-10-01 after the SEED-072
  integration found these two places still choosing wording by host name.

```

- **Goal:** A developer reading or continuing dashboard sessions sees each
  session described in its own host's terms, and receives notifications based
  on the observation's meaning. This removes inherited Claude Code or Codex
  assumptions before another host joins the shared dashboard.
- **Scope:**
  - Read host-specific unknown-observation wording through the host description
    supplied by `SEED-075#one-host-description`. Preserve Claude Code's and
    Codex's existing wording wherever it already names the correct host.
  - Name the recorded session's host in an unavailable-session terminal attach
    refusal and in its continuation label. Keep the recorded continuation
    command, workspace, and notice intact; a label does not establish a host
    capability or invent a continuation.
  - Produce pending execution and refinement wording for the selected host
    directly, including the launching phase after preparation. Preserve the
    preparation-phase wording. Shared presentation must not choose a host by
    name or replace a literal "Claude Code" to produce another host's words.
  - Let the host's observation distinguish an explicit unrecognized native
    state from an incomplete read and supply the fact governing an
    unrecognized-state alert. Shared presentation and alerting consume that
    fact without checking the host's name. Explicit unrecognized Codex native
    statuses alert; incomplete or unreadable observations stay quiet.
  - Preserve confirmed absence versus unknown observation, existing recognized
    activity readings, attention counts, and marked-done semantics. An
    unrecognized state stays unsettled and does not increase the number of
    sessions needing attention, even if it raises a notification. Preserve
    notification baselining and deduplication.
  - Correct the implicated launch-boundary and terminal-contract comments to
    describe supported hosts and the existing `host` query parameter.
- **Constraints:** A failed or partial read does not establish session absence
  or developer-needed activity. Unsupported operations stay unavailable; this
  story does not supply another host's operation or infer support from a label
  ([ADR 0005](../../docs/adrs/0005-cross-tool-validation-accepted.md)).
- **Deferred promises:** Cursor integration, additional continuation or terminal
  capabilities, changes to stored session records or their legacy defaults,
  launch gates, and a new notification delivery mechanism. These are delivery
  exclusions, not reasons to reject naturally supported host observations.
- **Key examples:**
  1. A recorded session cannot be observed → its state is displayed → Claude
     Code retains "State unknown: Claude Code's session list could not be
     read"; Codex retains "Live observation unavailable: Continue this
     conversation in Codex". Neither observation raises a notification or
     contributes to the attention count, and neither proves absence.
  2. A recorded session has continuation information → its entry is opened →
     the label is "Continue in <the session's host name>" and its saved command
     and workspace are shown unchanged. A session without continuation
     information gains no command merely from its host name.
  3. A host supports attachment and a kept session is confirmed unavailable →
     a terminal attach request reaches admission → it is refused and names
     that session's host. Claude Code keeps "Claude Code no longer lists this
     session"; Codex does not receive a Claude Code refusal.
  4. Execution or refinement is launching → the pending sentence is displayed
     → it says "Starting execution in Codex…" or "Starting refinement in
     Claude Code…" for the selected host. During start preparation it still
     says "Preparing execution…" or "Preparing refinement…".
  5. An unmarked session changes from a recognized state to an explicit native
     status the host cannot recognize → the page displays "State not
     recognized" with the host's description → it stays unsettled with no
     attention-count increase. Shared alerting follows the host-supplied fact;
    Claude Code continues to alert, and Codex now alerts too. The notification
    occurs once on entering that reading, not on every poll or startup baseline.
  6. Codex metadata confirms a retained conversation, but its latest turn cannot
     be read → the partial observation is presented with Codex's explanation →
     it stays quiet and available for supported continuation. The host reports
     the incomplete observation rather than shared code suppressing every
     unrecognized Codex state by name.
- **Decision:** Terry accepted the proposed Codex alert policy on 2026-10-01:
  explicit unrecognized native statuses alert, as Claude Code's do; incomplete
  or unreadable observations stay quiet. The host reports the observation's
  meaning; shared presentation contains no host-name exception. No goal,
  scope, or example decision remains open.
- **Current basis:** `dashboard/src/sessionShown.ts` selects unknown wording
  and suppresses unrecognized-state alerts by host name.
  `dashboard/server/hosts/codex/sessions.ts` can distinguish unexpected native
  statuses from a failed latest-turn read, but currently represents both as
  available activity `unknown` with a description.
  `dashboard/tests/agent-launch-codex-observation-alerts.spec.ts` confirms both
  currently stay quiet. The other affected wording and contracts are in
  `dashboard/server/agentLaunchAdmission.ts`, `dashboard/src/LaunchSession.tsx`,
  `dashboard/src/launchWorkflow.ts`, `dashboard/src/StartLaunch.tsx`,
  `dashboard/server/agentLaunchPlugin.ts`, and `dashboard/src/agentTerminal.ts`.
- **Plan:** [Session meaning and wording follow the host](../slice-plans/203-host-neutral-session-meaning/PLAN.md).
- **Depends on:** The delivered and verified first slice of
  SEED-075#one-host-description, not that story's completion.
- **Execution handoff (2026-10-01):** Terry selected readiness with an autonomous
  wait. The executing agent polls remote trunk itself for the prerequisite's
  first-slice delivery, integrates and verifies its actual description/registry
  contract in the plan's early probe, then continues automatically. Until that
  probe succeeds, no dependent product edits start. The other story's remaining
  slices may run in parallel. Goal, scope and key examples remain unchanged.
- **Capture:** Terry selected it on 2026-10-01 from the dashboard multi-tool
  architecture review.
